{\bf 07.12} \quad a) First, an understanding that the wording here implies that $X$ is actually "failures" of weapons. So the given $p$ would normally be $q$ in other contexts. So using the binomial theorem we would have $p = .05$ and $q = .95$. Knowing that we can use the Binomial theorem easily:
\begin{align*}
	\Pr \left( X \geq 1 \right) & = 1 - \Pr \left( X < 1 \right ) \\
	& = 1 - {n \choose 0} (.05)^0 (.95)^{n} \\
\end{align*}
We now solve for $n$ from the above equation knowing that the desired probability is $.99$ \\
\begin{align*}
	.99 & = 1 - (.95)^{n} \\
	\ln .95^{n} & = \ln .01 \\
	n & = \frac{\ln .01}{\ln .95} \\
\end{align*}
So n, since it must be an integer, is rounded to 90.
\\
b) Solve using Normal Approximation
$\mu = .05n$ and $\sigma = \sqrt{n*.05*(1-.05)}$
\Pr \left( X \geq 1 \right) & = 0.99
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
	\Pr\left( X geq 1\right)  & = \Pr\left(\frac{Z - .05n}{\sqrt{n*.05*(1-.05)}  geq \frac{1-0.5-.05n}{ \sqrt{n*.05*(1-.05)}}\right) \\
		& =\Pr\left(Z geq -2.33) = 0.99\\
 		&  \Pr\left(Z geq \frac{0.5-.05n}{ \sqrt{.0475n}}\right) = 0.99 \\
		& \frac{0.5-.058n}{\sqrt(.0475n} = -2.33 \\
		
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
Solving for n yields 122 units.
\\
c) Solve using Poisson Approximation
\begin{align*}
	\Pr \left( X \geq 1 \right) & = 1 - \Pr \left( X < 1 \right ) \\
	\frac{\exp(-.05n)(.05n)^0}{0!}
	\exp(-.05n)=0.01
	n & = \frac{-\ln.01}{.05} = 
Solving for n and rounding to the nearest integer yields n = 92
